Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

##### Example1:

> **Input:** a = "11", b = "1"
> **Output:** "100"

##### Example2:

> **Input:** a = "1010", b = "1011"
> **Output:** "10101"

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
