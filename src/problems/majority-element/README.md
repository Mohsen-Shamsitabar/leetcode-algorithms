### Majority Element (medium)

> https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.

**The majority element** is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

##### Example1:

> **Input:** `nums = [3,2,3]`.
> **Output:** `3`.

##### Example2:

> **Input:** `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`.
> **Output:** `2`.

##### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

##### Follow-up:

Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
